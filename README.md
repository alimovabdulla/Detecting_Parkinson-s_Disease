# Parkinson Disease Classification Model

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to classify Parkinson's disease using a Random Forest classifier. The model is built using Python and several popular libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Seaborn. The dataset used is from the Parkinson's Disease dataset available on Kaggle.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the presence of Parkinson's disease based on various health-related features. The model uses the Random Forest Classifier for classification and evaluates performance based on accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Parkinson’s Disease dataset, which contains data on various features such as voice and motor characteristics of individuals. The target variable is the `status` column, where 0 indicates no Parkinson’s disease and 1 indicates the presence of Parkinson’s disease.

- **Data source**: Kaggle Parkinson’s Disease dataset

## Model Architecture

The model is built using a **Random Forest Classifier** in a **Scikit-learn pipeline** with the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Text features are transformed into numerical values using the **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.
   - Features are scaled using **StandardScaler** for normalization.

2. **Model Building**: 
   - A **Random Forest Classifier** is used for classification. 
   - The model is trained and evaluated on a test set with an 80/20 split.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Model performance is assessed using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
